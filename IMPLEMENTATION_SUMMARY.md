## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Components Built:

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Navigation | Top nav with search, links, auth | `components/Navigation.tsx` |
| FollowButton | Follow/unfollow UI | `components/profile/FollowButton.tsx` |
| PhotoUpload | Avatar & cover photo upload | `components/profile/PhotoUpload.tsx` |
| ForgeInteractions | Like, comment, share buttons | `components/forges/ForgeInteractions.tsx` |
| ProfileHeader | User profile header with edit | `components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx` |
| FaceCanvas | Forge grid with drag-drop | `components/profile/FaceCanvas.tsx` |

### Key APIs Built:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/search` | GET | Search profiles |
| `/api/profiles` | GET/PUT | Get and update profiles |
| `/api/profiles/upload` | POST | Upload avatar/cover photo |
| `/api/forges` | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | Manage Forges |
| `/api/allies` | GET/POST/DELETE | Follow/unfollow creators |
| `/api/interactions` | POST/DELETE | Like/unlike Forges |
| `/api/spark-feed` | GET | Get personalized feed |

### Data Flow:

```
User Actions → API Endpoints → Database → Real-time Updates
                    ↓
              RLS Policies
              (Data Privacy)
                    ↓
              Supabase Realtime
              (Notifications)
```

## Spark Algorithm Details

### Scoring Formula:
```javascript
let score = 0

// Bonus if from someone you follow
if (followerIds.includes(forge.user_id)) score += 10

// Bonus if template matches your interests
if (userInteractionTemplates.includes(forge.template_type)) score += 5

// Recency bonuses
if (createdDaysAgo < 1) score += 5  // Last 24 hours
else if (createdDaysAgo < 7) score += 3  // Last 7 days

// Result: Ranked by highest score
```

### Why This Works:
- **Allies Bonus**: Prioritizes creators you trust
- **Interest Matching**: Shows content you like
- **Recency**: Fresh content gets visibility
- **Deduplication**: No repeat Forges in feed
- **Real-time**: Updates as you interact
