### 3. Graph - Social Discovery
**Location**: `/dashboard` (manage), `/spark` (discover)

#### Allies (Followers)
- Follow other creators to see their latest Forges
- Get updates when people you follow publish new work
- Build your creator network

**How to use:**
1. Visit someone's profile page
2. Click "Follow" to become their Ally
3. Their published Forges appear in your personalized Spark feed

#### Builders (Collaborators)
- Invite others to collaborate on specific Forges
- Assign roles: owner, editor, collaborator
- Work together on Forge content and configuration

---

### 4. Spark - Personalized Discovery Algorithm
**Location**: `/spark`

The Spark feed shows you Forges tailored to your interests, updated in real-time.

#### How the Algorithm Works

The Spark algorithm uses a scoring system that calculates relevance for every Forge:

**Scoring Factors (in order of importance):**

1. **Following Bonus (+10 points)**
   - Forges from creators you follow appear first
   - Ensures you stay connected to people you care about

2. **Interest Matching (+5 points)**
   - Based on your interaction history
   - If you've interacted with Portfolio Forges, more Portfolio recommendations appear
   - Learning what you like and showing more of it

3. **Recency Bonus**
   - Last 24 hours: +5 points
   - Last 7 days: +3 points
   - Promotes fresh content while allowing discovery of older gems

4. **Deduplication**
   - Each Forge appears only once (most relevant position)
   - Prevents duplicate listings in your feed

#### Feed Generation Process

1. **Gather Data**
   - Get list of Forges you follow (from Allies)
   - Get list of Forges matching your interests
   - Get all published Forges in the system

2. **Calculate Scores**
   - For each Forge, calculate relevance score
   - Weight based on your history and connections

3. **Rank & Return**
   - Sort by score (highest first)
   - Return 50 Forges per page (limit: 20 shown at once)

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Powered by Supabase Realtime
   - New Forges appear instantly
   - Scores update when people follow you or interact with Forges

#### Interaction Tracking

Every time you interact with a Forge, it's recorded:

**Interaction Types:**
- **View**: Automatically tracked when you visit a Forge
- **Like**: Rate Forges you love
- **Share**: Share Forges with others (bookmarking)
- **Comment**: Leave feedback (planned)

These interactions improve the algorithm's recommendations.
